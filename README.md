Navty is an personal safety navigation iOS app that allows users to choose routes based on NYPD incident reports. The crime incidents reports are populated on a mapView powered by Google Maps SDK. The user enters their destination and Navty generates the fastest route. If they choose to change their route a simple long press on the map where they would like to go through is needed. The app gives a User Notification once arriving at their destination allowing the user to send a text message to pre-selected contacts that they have arrived home safely.
