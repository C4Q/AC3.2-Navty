# Navty

Navty is an personal safety navigation app that allows users to choose routes based on NYPD incident reports. The crime incidents reports are populated on a mapView powered by Google Maps SDK. The user adds in their destination where they recieve the faster route to their destination. If they choose to change their route all it takes it a simple long press on the map where they would like to go through. The app gives a User Notification once arriving at their destination allowing the user to send a text message to pre-selected contacts that they have arrived home safely.
